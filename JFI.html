            <h1>UAV Education & Outreach Program</h1>

            </ul>
            <p>As part of the UAV Education & Outreach Program, I’ve had the opportunity to engage students from MOE and international secondary schools through interactive drone and aerospace workshops. These sessions introduce students to the fundamentals of UAVs, flight dynamics, and real-world drone applications.</p>
            
            <p>Each workshop covers essential topics like multirotor stability, flight control, and safety procedures. We also incorporate flight simulators to let students experience flying drones in a safe, controlled virtual environment — helping them build confidence before hands-on practice. In addition, students are introduced to basic 3D modelling techniques, where they design their own gliders or drone parts using intuitive CAD software.</p>

            <p>These outreach experiences have been both inspiring and fulfilling. Beyond technical content, they encourage creativity, teamwork, and curiosity in STEM fields. For me, it's a chance to give back, apply my aerospace knowledge, and help nurture the next generation of engineers and innovators.</p>
